# Product Requirements Document AskPDF

AskPDF is an advanced, locally-deployed system designed to revolutionize how researchers interact with and extract insights from technical papers in the field of Artificial Intelligence. The product employs a sophisticated, NoSQL-based, idempotent, stateless, and declarative system design pipeline to process, analyze, and query research papers efficiently.

## Product Overview

### Intelligent Document Processing
AskPDF ingests PDF research papers, extracting and structuring content including text, figures, tables, and metadata. It utilizes advanced NLP techniques to understand the semantic structure of documents.

### Multi-Stage Processing Pipeline
The system implements a comprehensive, multi-stage processing pipeline to analyze and enrich research paper content:

1. Pre-processor Stage
2. Analytical Stage
3. Visualization and Analytical Stage
4. Semantic Stage
5. Reasoning Stage

### Vector-Based Knowledge Representation
The system converts extracted information into high-dimensional vector representations, enabling semantic understanding and comparison of research concepts, methodologies, and results across multiple papers.

### Multimodal Information Retrieval
AskPDF provides a unified search interface that allows users to query across text, figures, and tables, facilitating comprehensive exploration of research content.

### Cross-Paper Analysis
The system enables users to easily compare and contrast methodologies, datasets, and results across multiple papers, accelerating the identification of trends and state-of-the-art techniques in AI research.

### Interactive Querying
Users can ask natural language questions about the papers, receiving context-specific answers as if conversing with a knowledgeable researcher familiar with all the processed papers.

### Scalable Local Deployment
AskPDF is designed to run entirely on local infrastructure, ensuring data privacy and eliminating reliance on cloud-based APIs. Its architecture supports scaling from personal use to larger research group deployments.

### Extensibility
The system's modular design allows for easy integration of new analysis techniques, embedding models, or search capabilities as AI research evolves.

## Problem Statement
Learning about core AI and AI engineering requires studying numerous technical research papers to stay up-to-date on different fundamentals and trends. The challenge lies in accelerating understanding from this vast array of technical literature. While generative AI APIs like ChatGPT could potentially assist, their use would be costly and unsustainable for this purpose.

## Inspiration
The product's approach is inspired by observations of specific patterns in reading and extracting information from research papers at different levels of comprehension. These insights will be used to preprocess PDF files before extracting embeddings. The backend will innovate in storing, processing, and retrieving these embeddings effectively.

## Motive
AskPDF is focused specifically on technical research papers in core AI, aiming to create a significant impact for researchers in this field.
